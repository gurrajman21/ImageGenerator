# ImageGenerator
A little project I created using the OpenAI image generator API. I used the Flask web framework for this website since Flask has built in debugging which
helped me debug it and get it up and running. This will not work if you try to download it and run it in the Flask development server since it is missing the OpenAI
private key (unfortunatly I cannot leave that in the files since it's against their user policies to publicly display the key), you may sign up for your own OpenAI account and add your own private key if you would like to test it out (go to the env file and type your key into the OPENAI_API_KEY spot).
